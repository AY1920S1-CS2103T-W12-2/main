== Introduction
THRIFT is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. Maintain records of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions and constantly keep track of your spending and income! THRIFT is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want a simple, no-frills finance tracker, look no further than THRIFT!

This is how THRIFT looks like:

[[BudgetTag]]
=== Setting monthly budget: `budget`

You are able to set a budget for each month in THRIFT. This allows THRIFT to display your remaining balance for the month and lets you keep your spending in check.

NOTE: It is not compulsory to set a budget for each month and you can use THRIFT normally without setting budgets.

==== Command syntax:
`budget v/VALUE d/MONTH/YEAR`

****
* Sets your budget for the month specified in `MONTH/YEAR` as `VALUE`.
* `VALUE` is any positive value below one billion (it can be 0).
* `MONTH` is in `MM` where it is between `01-12` inclusive.
* `YEAR` is in `YYYY` where it is between `0001-9999` inclusive.
****

==== Example usage:

You wish to set your budget for the month _October 2019_ as $_2000_:

. Your current budget for the month _October 2019_ is $_0_.
+
image::add-budget/Step1.png[,550]

. You type: **budget v/2000 d/10/2019** in the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::add-budget/Step2.png[,550]

. You should see in the result box that your budget for _October 2019_ has been set to $_2000_.
+
NOTE: If you are changing your budget for the current displayed month, you should see the changes on the GUI immediately.
+
image::add-budget/Step3.png[,550]

[[ExpenseTag]]
=== Adding an expense: `add_expense`

One of the most important features of THRIFT is to allow you to track your expenses by adding them into THRIFT.

==== Command syntax:
`add_expense n/EXPENSE_NAME v/VALUE [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]...`

****
[[TransactionDetailsTag]]
* Adds an expense with:
** the name `EXPENSE_NAME`
** the value `VALUE`
** an optional remark `REMARK`
** one or more optional `TAG`
* `VALUE` is a positive number with an optional decimal point, which if specified, accepts up to 2 decimal digits.
* `TAG` does not have spaces nor special characters.
****

TIP: The default currency is in Singapore Dollars (SGD). You are recommended to `convert` foreign currencies to SGD before adding the value as the `VALUE`.

==== Example usage:
You had the famous Laksa from "The Deck" for lunch which cost $10.50 and you wish to track it in THRIFT:

. You have a remaining balance of $2000 at the beginning.

+
image::add-transaction/expense/Step3.png[,550]

[[IncomeTag]]
=== Adding an income: `add_income`
Being able to add an income transaction is just as important as tracking your expenses. THRIFT is able to track all of your incoming transactions as well.

==== Command syntax:
`add_income n/INCOME_NAME v/VALUE [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Adds an income with:
** the name `INCOME_NAME`

+
image::delete/Step3.png[,550]

// tag::update[]
[[UpdateTag]]
=== Updating a transaction’s details: `update`
Made a mistake when creating a transaction? Have new details for an existing transaction? Simply utilize THRIFT's `update` feature to make changes.

==== Command Syntax:
`update i/INDEX [n/NEW_NAME] [v/NEW_VALUE] [r/NEW_REMARK] [t/NEW_TAG] ...`

Here is an explanation for the `update` command:
****
* Use this command to update the fields of the transaction at the specified `INDEX`.

- `INDEX` refers to the index number currently shown in the displayed list, and must be a *positive integer*.

* You can update any or all of the transaction's **name**, **value**, **remark** and **tags** fields. For information on these fields, see <<TransactionDetailsTag, here>>.

* All fields are optional, but you must specify at least one field to be updated.

* You can update multiple fields at once.
****

==== Example Usage:
You order a bowl of delicious Laksa and key in the details of this food expense into THRIFT. However, after your meal you realize you recorded some incorrect details - the Laksa was _Asam Laksa_, not Curry Laksa as you thought, and you paid more than the menu price (which you recorded) due to taxes. You also want to add a remark and tag.

Fortunately, you can easily update such details in THRIFT. Here is what you do from beginning to end:

. You initially have a "Curry Laksa" expense in THRIFT. It is at index 2 in the list.
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep1.png[,550]
+
. When you realize the Laksa is not Curry Laksa and want to change the transaction's name, you type **update i/2 n/Laksa** into the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep2.png[,550]
+
. You should see that the "Curry Laksa" transaction's name is updated to "Laksa". The status message also tells you what the original transaction was.
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep3.png[,550]
+
. Later on, you want to change the name and value, as well as add a remark and tag. You type: +
**update i/2 n/Asam Laksa v/12 r/My first time trying! t/Food t/Lunch** +
and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep4.png[,550]
+
. You can see the updated details of the transaction at index 2. The status message tells you what the original transaction was. The transaction month's Expense and Balance trackers are also updated.
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep5.png[,550]
// end::update[]

//tag::tag[]
[[TagTag]]
=== Tagging a transaction: `tag`

The `tag` command allows you to tag a `Transaction` entry.

==== Command Syntax:

`tag i/INDEX t/TAG_NAME...`

* Tags the transaction at the specified `INDEX` with `TAG_NAME` (can be more than one).
* `INDEX` refers to the index number currently shown in the UI (after filtering, if any).
* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...


==== Example:

1. You want to tag "Credit Card" (the entry displayed at index 2) with the tag _Debt_.


2. You type `tag i/2 t/Debt` into the command input and press **Enter**..


3. You now see that the entry has been tagged.


// end::tag[]

// tag::untag[]
[[UntagTag]]
=== Untagging a transaction: `untag`

The `untag` command allows you to un-tag a `Transaction` entry.

==== Command Syntax:

`untag i/INDEX t/TAG_NAME...`


* Untags `TAG_NAME` (can be more than one) from the transaction at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number currently shown in the UI (after filtering, if any).
* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...


==== Example:

1. You want to untag the tag _Important_ from "Humble Bundle" (the entry displayed at index 3).


2. You type `untag i/3 t/Important` into the command input and press **Enter**.


3. You see that the entry has been been un-tagged.

// end::untag[]

// tag::convert[]
[[ConvertTag]]
=== Converting currency: `convert`

The convert command allows you to convert money from one currency to another.

====  Command Syntax

`convert [v/VALUE] c/CURRENCY...`

* Converts the `VALUE` to `CURRENCY` if one of each is specified.
* If no `VALUE` is specified, the value of 1.00 with be used.
* If more than one `CURRENCY` is present, the first one will be used as a base and the rest as target currencies
* `VALUE` must be positive.

==== Example

1. You want to convert SGD1000 to USD.


2. You type `convert v/1000 c/USD` into the command input and press **Enter**.


3. The conversion message is displayed on the GUI.


// end::convert[]

// tag::clone[]
[[CloneTag]]
=== Cloning a transaction: `clone`
Occasionally, you may want to copy a transaction, or create multiple copies of a transaction for recurring incomes or expenses such as a yearly donation or monthly bills. Simply use the `clone` feature to achieve this.

==== Command syntax:
`clone i/INDEX [o/FREQUENCY:NUMBER_OF_OCCURRENCES]`

The following is an explanation for the `clone` command:

****
* Clones (creates duplicate(s) of) transaction at `INDEX`. Clones produced are added to new indices at the bottom of the list.

- `INDEX` refers to the index currently shown in the displayed list, and must be a positive integer.

* If you use `clone i/INDEX` without the `o/FREQUENCY:NUMBER_OF_OCCURRENCES` field, one clone is created for the current day.

* You use the optional `FREQUENCY:NUMBER_OF_OCCURRENCES` field to create multiple clones spanning from the original transaction.

- `FREQUENCY` is how often or how far apart the clones occur. Valid values are: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` and `yearly`.

- `NUMBER_OF_OCCURRENCES` determines how many clones are produced. If `NUMBER_OF_OCCURRENCES` is 0, the result is exactly the same as `clone i/INDEX` without the entire `FREQUENCT:NUMBER_OF_OCCURRENCES` field.

- The maximum `NUMBER_OF_OCCURRENCES` is **5 for `yearly`** and **12 for `daily`, `weekly` and `monthly`**.

* For monthly cloning, clones are created on the same day as the original transaction's in subsequent months.

- For example, **clone i/1 o/monthly:3** on transaction at index 1 dated 20 November 2019 creates clones on 20 December 2019, 20 January 2020 and 20 February 2020.

* For special cases where subsequent months do not have the day corresponding to the original transaction's month, clones are created on the last day of those months.

- For example, **clone i/1 o/monthly:5** on transaction at index 1 dated 31 October 2019 creates clones on 30 November 2019, 31 December 2019, 31 January 2020 and 29 February 2020 (2020 is a leap year).
****

==== Example usage: +
You receive your fixed salary on the 30th of every month. You don't want to tediously add your salary to THRIFT every month, so you add clones of your salary income for the next year at one go.

You do the following on 30 November 2019:

NOTE: The following example uses the displayed list of all existing transactions.

. You have the salary income entry you received on 30/11/2019 in the list. It is at index 4.
+
image::clone/cloneUG/CloneStep1.png[,550]

. To create clones of the 30 November 2019 salary income for the next 12 months from 30 December 2019 up to 30 November 2020, you type **clone i/4 o/monthly:12** and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::clone/cloneUG/CloneStep2.png[,550]

. You can see that 12 clones of the transaction at index 4 are created.
+
image::clone/cloneUG/CloneStep3.png[,550]
// end::clone[]

[[UndoTag]]
=== Undoing the previous undoable command: `undo`
Do not panic if you have accidentally made a mistake in THRIFT, like deleting the wrong transaction.
THRIFT provides an `undo` command to solve your trouble! You can revert to the previous state
of THRIFT using `undo`.

NOTE: `Undo` can only apply to undoable commands. Undoable commands refers to commands that modify the data of the THRIFT application.

WARNING: You cannot undo undoable commands once the application exits.

List of undoable commands[[Undoable]]:

* `<<ExpenseTag, add_expense>>`
* `<<IncomeTag, add_income>>`
* `<<DeleteTag, delete>>`
* `<<UpdateTag, update>>`
* `<<CloneTag, clone>>`
* `<<TagTag, tag>>`
* `<<UntagTag, untag>>`
* `<<BudgetTag, budget>>`

==== Command syntax:
`undo`

==== Example usage:
Suppose you want to delete the second transaction (Bursary) in THRIFT, but you remove the third transaction (Chicken Rice) instead!
One possible solution is that you add the transaction manually back into THRIFT, but this is too troublesome! You can
retrieve the deleted transaction by performing `undo`.

To `undo` the `delete` command:

. Type *undo* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter]:
+
image::UndoAndRedo/undocommand.png[, 550]

. You will see a success message displays in the result box, and the transaction (Chicken Rice)
adds back to its original position in the list:
+
image::UndoAndRedo/undocommandresult.png[, 550]

[[RedoTag]]
=== Redoing the undone command: `redo`
Misuse of `undo` command? No worries, THRIFT provides `redo` command to help you in this situation.
You can restore the previous state of the undone transaction.

NOTE: `Redo` command is only applicable to <<Undoable, undoable command>>.

WARNING: You cannot redo undone commands once the application exits or new undoable command is executed after `undo`.

==== Command syntax:
`redo`

==== Example usage:
Suppose you had undone the addition of the transaction (Chicken Rice) (See: <<UndoTag, Undoing the previous undoable command>>),
but you decide to track the transaction using THRIFT. Instead of adding the transaction manually, you can add back
the transaction by executing `redo`.

To `redo` undone `add_expense` command:

. Type *redo* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter]:
+
image::UndoAndRedo/redocommand.png[, 550]

. You will see a success message displays in the result box and the transaction (Chicken Rice) adds back to the list:
+
image::UndoAndRedo/redocommandresult.png[, 550]


[[FindTag]]
=== Finding transactions with keywords: `find`
THRIFT lets you find and list all transactions whose `REMARK` or `DESCRIPTION` contain your specified search term. `DESCRIPTION` is
the name of the transaction which you enter as `n/DESCRIPTION`.

==== Command syntax:
`find SEARCH_WORD [SEARCH_WORD]`

****
* Multiple `SEARCH_WORD` can be defined, and transactions that matches any of a `SEARCH_WORD` will be listed.
****

==== Example usage:
Imagine that you wish to find all of your transactions that contain the words _The Deck_ because you would like to see
how often you visit there.

. Your transaction list already contains a few transactions with meals that you ate at _The Deck_:
+
image::find/Step1.png[,550]

. You want to refine your search to only show transactions that contain the keywords _The Deck_. You type:
**find The Deck** and press kbd:[Enter]:
+
image::find/Step2.png[,550]

. Your transaction list will now only contain transactions containing the words _The_ or _Deck_.
+
image::find/Step3.png[,550]

[[ListTag]]
=== Listing transactions with the use of filters: `list`
THRIFT allows you to list out all the transactions, and filter by month if you wish to as well.

==== Command syntax:
`list [m/MONTH]`

****
* Sets the filter to the month specified in `MONTH`.
* `MONTH` is in `MM/YYYY`:
** `MM` is between `01-12`.
** `YYYY` is between `0001-9999`.
* If `m/MONTH` is left out then all transactions will be shown.
****

==== Example usage:
Imagine that you wanted to take a look at how much you spent and saved the previous month! For example, Oct 2019.

To `list` the transactions of Oct 2019:

. The default interface shows all transactions for the current month, in this case Nov 2019.
+
image::list/Step1.png[,550]

. You can simply type *list m/10/2019* into the command input and press kbd:[Enter]:
+
image::list/Step2.png[,550]

. Your transaction list will now show all transactions that were added in Oct 2019!
+
image::list/Step3.png[,550]

[[HelpTag]]
=== Displaying help page: `help`
New to THRIFT? Or forget about some of the commands used in THRIFT? You can run *help* to obtain the link to this
comprehensive user guide. It saves the trouble of saving the URL of this user guide.

==== Command syntax:
`help [COMMAND]`

==== Example usage:
Suppose you want to add a transaction to THRIFT, but you had forgotten about the command to perform this function.

To get the URL of this user guide:

1. Type *help* in the command box and press kbd:[Enter]:
+
image::Help-exit/helpcommand.PNG[]

2. You will see the URL of the user guide in the popup window:
+
image:Help-exit/userguideurl.PNG[]

TIP: Alternative methods: press kbd:[F1] or click on *Help* in the menu bar, and then click on *Help* in its sub menu.

However, if you just want to view the usage syntax of the `add_expense` command because you had forgotten the exact format,
you can enter *help add_expense* instead of *help*.

You will see a simplified help version of the `add_expense` command displays in the result box:

image::Help-exit/specifichelpcommand.PNG[]

[[ExitTag]]
=== Exiting THRIFT application: `exit`
Think about exiting THRIFT after you have added the transaction? You can enter *exit* in the
command box or click on the close button at the top-right corner of the application.

=== Generating an external report `[coming in v2.0]`

With this feature, you will be able to save your monthly budget report into an external file for your record purposes. The report will clearly state your expenditure, income and remaining budget for the month.


=== Recommending dining options based on budget `[coming in v2.0]`

Depending on your remaining budget and the remaining days to the end of the month, THRIFT will recommend you dining places in NUS which will suit your budget. For example, if you are running low on funds, you might get recommended to travel to the Arts canteen to eat since there are really cheap options there.


=== Encrypting THRIFT data `[coming in v2.0]`

If you are especially conscious about having your data spied on, this function will definitely ease your worries. With encryption enabled, your data will not be known to the intruder should they steal your THRIFT application data.
