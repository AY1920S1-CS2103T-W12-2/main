== Introduction
THRIFT is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. Maintain records of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions and constantly keep track of your spending and income! THRIFT is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want a simple, no-frills finance tracker, look no further than THRIFT!



== Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest THRIFT.jar https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-2/main/releases[here].
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your THRIFT application.
4. Double-click the file to start the app, the GUI should appear in a few seconds.
5. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.
6. Some example commands you can try:
*   `add_expense n/Apple Airpods c/200`: adds an expense called `Apple Airpods` which cost $`200`.
*   `add_income n/Bursary Award c/350`: adds an income called `Bursary Award` which incremented your budget by $`350`.
*   `delete i/1`: deletes the 1st transaction in the current list shown in the UI.


== Features:

Command format:

*   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. `expense n/EXPENSE_NAME c/COST`.
*   Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional e.g. `n/EXPENSE_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Laksa t/Food`.
*   Items in round brackets `( )` with `|` are mandatory parameters where a selection is needed e.g. `tag (add | delete)` means you need to input either `tag add` or `tag delete`.
*   Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG] …` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Food t/Dinner` etc.
*   Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/EXPENSE_NAME c/COST`, `c/COST n/EXPENSE_NAME` will achieve the same outcome.
