== Introduction
THRIFT is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. Maintain records of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions and constantly keep track of your spending and income! THRIFT is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want a simple, no-frills finance tracker, look no further than THRIFT!

This is how THRIFT looks like:

[[BudgetTag]]
=== Setting monthly budget: `budget`

You are able to set a budget for each month in THRIFT. This allows THRIFT to display your remaining balance for the month and lets you keep your spending in check.

NOTE: It is not compulsory to set a budget for each month and you can use THRIFT normally without setting budgets.

==== Command syntax:
`budget v/VALUE d/MONTH`

****
* Sets your budget for the month specified in `MONTH` as `VALUE`.
* `VALUE` is any positive integer below one billion.
* `MONTH` is in `MM/YYYY` and `MM` is between `01-12`.
****

==== Example usage:

You wish to set your budget for the month _October 2019_ as $_2000_:

. Your current budget for the month _October 2019_ is $_0_.
+
image::add-budget/Step1.png[,550]

. You type: **budget v/2000 d/10/2019** in the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::add-budget/Step2.png[,550]

. You should see in the result box that your budget for _October 2019_ has been set to $_2000_.

* `<<DeleteTag, delete>>`
* `<<UpdateTag, update>>`
* `<<CloneTag, clone>>`
* `<<TagTag, tag>>`
* `<<UntagTag, untag>>`
* `<<BudgetTag, budget>>`

==== Command syntax:
Format: `undo`

==== Example usage:
Suppose you want to delete the second transaction (Bursary) in THRIFT, but you remove the third transaction instead!

the transaction by executing `redo`.
