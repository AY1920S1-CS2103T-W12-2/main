== Introduction
<<thrift, THRIFT>> is an application for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money.
It maintain records of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions and constantly keep track of the user's spending and income.
THRIFT is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is a simple, no-frills finance tracker made for the target user group.

=== Purpose

This developer guide aims to communicate to the developers working on THRIFT the design and architecture of the implementation.
It also includes non-technical details to give the developers an idea of the direction THRIFT intends to take on both current and future features.
A developer should be able to understand the design, architecture and goals of THRIFT after reading this guide.

=== Scope

This developer guide specifies the technical and non-technical details of THRIFT.
The technical aspects include the design and architecture while the non-technical aspects include the user stories, use cases and <<nfr, NFRs>>.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The architecture diagram given above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/thrift/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/thrift/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At application launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `**LogsCenter**` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the application's log file.

The rest of the application consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Displays the UI of the application.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes the various commands.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the application in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an interface with the same name as the component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `**{Component Name}Manager**` class.

For example, the `**Logic**` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the _Logic.java_ interface and exposes its functionality using the _LogicManager.java_ class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command **delete i/1**.

.Component interactions for **delete i/1** command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/thrift/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `**MainWindow**` that is made up of parts e.g.`**BalanceBar**`, `**CommandBox**`, `**ResultDisplay**`, `**TransactionListPanel**`, `**StatusBarFooter**` etc. All these, including the `**MainWindow**`, inherit from the abstract `**UiPart**` class.

The `**UI**` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching _.fxml_ files that are in the _src/main/resources/view_ folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/thrift/ui/MainWindow.java[**`MainWindow`**] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`**MainWindow.fxml**`]

The `**UI**` component,

* Executes user commands using the `**Logic**` component.
* Listens for changes to `**Model**` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/thrift/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `**Logic**` uses the `**ThriftParser**` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `**Command**` object which is executed by the `**LogicManager**`.
.  The command execution can affect the `**Model**` (e.g. adding a `**Transaction**`).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `**CommandResult**` object which is passed back to the `**Ui**`.
.  In addition, the `**CommandResult**` object can also instruct the `**Ui**` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `**Logic**` component for the **execute("delete i/1")** API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete i/1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/thrift/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `**Model**`,

* stores a `**UserPref**` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores `**THRIFT**` data.
* stores `**BudgetList**` which contains budget set for different months by the user.
* exposes an unmodifiable `**ObservableList<Transaction>**` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `**THRIFT**`, which `**Transaction**` can reference. This would allow `**THRIFT**` to only require one `**Tag**` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `**Transaction**` needing their own `**Tag**` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/thrift/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `**UserPref**` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `**THRIFT**` data in json format and read it back:
** `**JsonAdaptedTransaction**` stores `**Transaction**` objects in `JSON` format.
** `**JsonAdaptedTag**` stores `**Tag**` objects in `JSON` format, nested under `**JsonAdaptedTransaction**`.
** `**JsonAdaptedBudget**` stores `**Budget**` objects in `JSON` format.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `**thrift.commons**` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::budget[]
=== Add Expense/Income feature
==== Implementation
The **add_expense**/**add_income** feature is implemented through polymorphism. `**Expense**` and `**Income**` are both subclasses of the abstract class `Transaction`.
Each `**Transaction**` contains the following mandatory fields: `Description`, `TransactionDate` and `Value`; as well as optional fields: `Remark`,
and `Set<Tag>`.

image::add-transaction/Polymorphism.png[]

Because of this polymorphism relation, many of the driver functions in `THRIFT` simply references `Transaction` and it will work for both `Expense`
and `Income` transaction objects. For example, when inserting a new `Expense`/`Income`, the `AddTransactionCommandParser` will determine
which object to initialize:

.Sequence diagram of how adding a new `Transaction` is processed with polymorphism
image::add-transaction/PolymorphismCalling.png[]

`**Expense**` and `**Income**` are normally instantiated by either `ExpenseCommandParser#parse(String args)` or `IncomeCommandParser#parse(String args)`, which
attempts to parse the various parameters supplied in `args` and return either a `**Expense**` or `**Income**` object. The following conditions will cause a `**ParseException**`
to be thrown by the parser:

. Missing parameters
. Incorrect syntax (i.e. missing prefix, if it is required)
. Illegal values in parameters (i.e. special characters and symbols entered for a integer-only field)
. Multiple occurrences of parameters which only expects a single entry

[NOTE]
If the user input is incorrect due to any of the reasons above, the usage syntax will be shown.

Below is a given example on how a `**Transaction**` is added into `**THRIFT**` and how the back-end handles each step of the process:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. THRIFT does not contain any other `**Transaction**` and the user is
about to add their own. An empty transaction list is initialized.

image::add-transaction/AddTransaction0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes **add_expense n/Laksa v/3.50** to insert an `**Expense**` with `**Description**` set to "Laksa"
and `**Value**` set to "3.50". The `**TransactionDate**` is set to the user's current system date in the form "dd/mm/yyyy".
The input is now checked and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

* `**Description**` is parsed by `AddTransactionCommandParser#parseTransactionDescription(ArgumentMultimap)`
* `**Value**` is parsed by `AddTransactionCommandParser#parseTransactionValue(ArgumentMultimap)`
* `**TransactionDate**` is instantiated by `AddTransactionCommandParser#parseTransactionDate()`

TIP: `**ArgumentMultimap**` is a class that stores all the parsed parameters taken from the user input.

Since the user input is valid, the `**Expense**` is successfully created and inserted into the transaction list.
The transaction list now contains 1 `**Transaction**` object.

image::add-transaction/AddTransaction1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes **add_income n/Bursary v/500 r/Awarded for doing well in school** to insert an `**Income**` with
the `**Description**` set to "Bursary", `**Value**` set to "500" and `**Remark**` set to "Awarded for doing well in school".
The `**TransactionDate**` is set to the user's current system date in the form "dd/mm/yyyy". The input is now checked in
a similar fashion as in Step 2 except for:

* `**Remark**` is parsed by `AddTransactionCommandParser#parseTransactionRemark(ArgumentMultimap)`

Again, since the input is valid, the `**Income**` is successfully added into the transaction list. The transaction list
now contains 2 `**Transaction**` objects.

image::add-transaction/AddTransaction2.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a command to add a new `**Transaction**`:

.Activity diagram of adding a transaction into the transaction list
image::add-transaction/AddTransactionSequence.png[]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Differentiating between `**Expense**` and `**Income**`
* **Alternative 1: (current choice):** Introduce a `**Transaction**` parent class which both `**Expense**` and `**Income**`
extends from.
** Pros: Introduces polymorphism, easing references to either classes by simply referencing the `**Transaction**` object.
For example, using a single `**List<Transaction>**` instead of needing 2 separate lists `**List<Expense>**` and `**List<Income>**`.
** Cons: Reduces the readability of the program as polymorphism can be confusing.

* **Alternative 2:** Keep `**Expense**` and `**Income**` classes separate, with each having their own specialized methods.
** Pros: Maintains an intuitive design: `**Expense**` deducts money and `**Income**` increases money.
** Cons: Incurs significant overhead and duplicated codes since it is likely that both `**Expense**` and `**Income**` will
have very similar methods.

===== Aspect: Managing how `**Value**` is stored and handled in `**Expense**` and `**Income**`
* **Alternative 1: (current choice):** Disallow negative `**Value**` in `**Expense**` object, only using positive amount
for both `**Expense**` and `**Income**`
** Pros: Removes the need to implement support for inserting negative `**Value**`. This is due to how `**Value**` constraints
are applied when restoring `**THRIFT**` data from the data file.
** Cons: Requires the developer to negate the `**Value**` whenever calculations are done with a `**Expense**` object.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow only negative amount in `**Expense**` object and only positive amount in `**Income**` object
** Pros: Calculations become trivial: to get balance, sum up the entire `**List<Transaction>**`.
** Cons: Overhead to parse user input to allow only a single negative symbol and no other symbols.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `**java.util.logging**` package for logging. The `**LogsCenter**` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations:

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `**Logger**` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* The log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Detected a critical problem which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Exercise caution if continuing
* `INFO` : Display information showing the noteworthy actions by the application
* `FINE` : Display details that are usually not noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list
instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: _config.json_).
