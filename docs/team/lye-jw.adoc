== 1. Introduction
In 2019, I worked on a team project for CS2103T, a Year Two undergraduate software engineering module at the National
University of Singapore (NUS). This portfolio serves as a documentation of my contributions to that project, THRIFT.
Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase my abilities in coding and documentation.

=== 1.1. My team
I have worked with four other talented coders to implement features for the THRIFT product.
Each of us was assigned an additional role; I was the _Quality Assurance Manager_ in charge of ensuring our product met
user needs and functioned properly through testing. **Poh Jia Hao** was the _Project Manager_, **Lee Bo Qiang** was the
_User Experience Developer_, **Melvin Ang** was the _Software Architect_ and **Kenson Oen** was the _Process Analyst_.

=== 1.2. Project THRIFT
My team morphed the address book application https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook-Level3]
into THRIFT, a desktop finance tracker application. THRIFT is meant for NUS students who wish to keep track of all their
income and spending information to better control, manage and plan out their flow of money.

To that end, some of THRIFT's features include setting a monthly budget, adding and deleting income and expense-type
entries, updating details of entries, tagging and untagging entries with categories, listing entries in a given month,
creating copies of entries across periods of occurrence and converting currencies.

As part of the requirements for CS2103T, THRIFT has a simple and intuitive Command Line Interface - everything you want
to do is executed by typing a command in the Command Box indicated in Figure 1 below. The following image shows what
THRIFT looks like:

=== 1.3 Text formatting in this portfolio
The <<UGTag, Contributions to the User Guide>> and <<DGTag, Contributions to the Developer Guide>> sections use these
formatting styles for text that have special meaning:

NOTE: This symbol indicates information that you may want to take note of at certain points in the guide.

[horizontal]
*add_expense n/Laksa v/4*:: Bold text indicates user input.

== 2. Summary of contributions
This section provides an overview of my contributions to THRIFT. Entries in THRIFT are referred to as "transactions".
Text with grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates a class, like `Command`.

=== 2.1. Major enhancements

* I added the ability to **clone transactions**.
** What it does: The **clone** command creates one or multiple copies of a specified transaction. The user can set
the frequency of multiple copies across a **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly** or **yearly** period, for example one copy
per day for 7 days.
** Justification: This feature makes it much more convenient to create copies of a transaction. Most users have
similar recurring transactions across a period of time and will use this feature often.
** Highlights: I did some in-depth logical analysis to implement the logic for cloning one **or** multiple
transactions. A new `Occurrence` class was implemented after considering the design alternatives for representing
clone occurrences.

* I overhauled the function of **updating transactions** for THRIFT.
** What it does: The **update** command allows users to modify details of a transaction.
** Justification: Being able to update details of a transaction or rectify mistakes in transaction information is a
basic core feature.
** Highlights: I refactored AddressBook-Level3's **edit** feature to create an **update** command syntax suitable for
THRIFT, disallowing the inputting of multiple instances of the same field type which was previously allowed. I also
changed the way **update** saves the updated transaction as the old implementation only worked when all transactions in the list are unique.
** Credits: The **update** feature is built on https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#editing-a-person-edit[AddressBook-Level3's **edit**].

=== 2.2. Minor enhancements

* I implemented **scrolling** to items in the user interface list for some commands.
** What it does: Upon execution of commands that modify the displayed list or its transaction entries like
**add_expense** and **update**, the user interface scrolls to the modified item.
** Justification: The user can immediately see the result of their command instead of needing to manually scroll and
find the modified transaction.
** Highlights: I divided all `Command` classes into children of `ScrollingCommand` and `NonScrollingCommand`. Commands under
`ScrollingCommand` make the user interface scroll to the modified transaction in the list after command execution.

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide

This section showcases part of my contributions to the User Guide, demonstrating my ability to write documentation
as a guide for end users making use of the product.

The User Guide uses this text style in addition to <<PPPFormattingTag, those in this portfolio's section 1.3>>:

`update`:: Text with grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates anything related to the explanation of user input.

----------_{Start of extract from User Guide}_----------

=== Updating a transactionâ€™s details: `update`
Made a mistake when creating a transaction? Have new details for an existing transaction? Simply utilize THRIFT's
`update` feature to make changes.

==== Command syntax
To execute the `update` command, you have to use the following syntax:

`update i/INDEX [n/NEW_NAME] [v/NEW_VALUE] [r/NEW_REMARK] [t/NEW_TAG] ...`

Here is an explanation for the `update` command:
****
* Use this command to update the fields of the transaction at the specified `INDEX`.

- `INDEX` refers to the index number currently shown in the displayed list, and must be a positive integer.

* You can update any or all of the transaction's name, value, remark and tags fields. For information on
these fields, see <<../UserGuide.adoc#TransactionDetailsTag, here>>.

* All fields are optional, but you must specify at least one field to be updated.

* You can update multiple fields at once.
****

==== Example usage
You order a bowl of delicious Laksa and key in the details of this food expense into THRIFT. However, after your meal
you realize you recorded some incorrect details - the Laksa was _Asam Laksa_, not Curry Laksa as you thought, and you
paid more than the menu price (which you recorded) due to taxes. You also want to add a remark and tag.

Fortunately, you can easily update such details in THRIFT. Here is what you do from beginning to end:

. You initially have a "Curry Laksa" expense in THRIFT. It is at index 2 in the list.
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep1.png[,500]
+
. When you realize the Laksa is not Curry Laksa and want to change the transaction's name, you type
**update i/2 n/Laksa** into the Command Box and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep2.png[,500]
+
. You should see that the "Curry Laksa" transaction's name is updated to "Laksa". The status message also tells you what
the original transaction was.
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep3.png[,500]
+
. Later on, you want to change the name and value, as well as add a remark and tag. You type: +
**update i/2 n/Asam Laksa v/12 r/My first time trying! t/Food t/Lunch** +
and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::update/updateUG/UpdateStep4.png[,500]
+
. You can see the updated details of the transaction at index 2. The status message tells you what the original
transaction was. The transaction month's Expense and Balance trackers are also updated.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

This section showcases part of my contributions to the Developer Guide, which conveys the technical intricacies of my
work on the project. It demonstrates my ability to write technical documentation.

The Developer Guide uses these text styles in addition to <<PPPFormattingTag, those in this portfolio's section 1.3>>:

[horizontal]
`currentMonth`:: Text with grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that it is a method/variable/parameter name.

`**THRIFT**`:: Bold text with mark-up indicates a class/package name.

=== Cloning transactions
The **clone** feature creates one or more duplicates of a specified `**Transaction**` and adds them to the end of the
existing transactions list.

==== Implementation
An `**Index**` and `**Occurrence**` are obtained from their representation in user input. The `**Index**` specifies
which transaction to clone, while the `**Occurrence**` informs THRIFT how many clones of the transaction should be
created (`Occurrence#numOccurrences`) and the time period between them (`Occurrence#frequency`).

Here is a Class Diagram for the implementation of `**Occurrence**`:

.Implementation of `**Occurrence**` class
image::clone/cloneDG/OccurrenceClassDiagram.png[]

The *clone* functionality is facilitated by common <<../DeveloperGuide.adoc#Design-Logic, *Logic*>> operations and classes for commands, with
feature-specific classes `**CloneCommand**` in place of `**Command**`, and `**CloneCommandParser**`.
The following methods are concrete implementations unique to **clone**:

* `CloneCommandParser#parse()` - Parses user input to extract an `**Index**` and create an `**Occurrence**`, then passes
them as parameters to a new `**CloneCommand**` for execution.
* `CloneCommand#execute()` - Adds one or more identical copies of specified `**Transaction**` to `**Model**`, then
returns a `**CommandResult**` (<<Design-Logic, Step 4 of Logic>>).

The following Sequence Diagram illustrates **clone** command execution:

.Sequence diagram for **clone** execution with 12 occurrences on an `**Expense**`
image::clone/cloneDG/CloneSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Example of usage
Given next is an example usage scenario for cloning a transaction and explanation of how the **clone** mechanism behaves
at each step:

[NOTE]
This entire scenario uses the list of all transactions.

Step 1. The user starts up the application with an initial list loaded from external storage file. The diagram here
depicts the example list used throughout this scenario. In particular, this example will observe the cloning of the
transaction at index 4.

:figure-caption!:
.Example list on startup
image::clone/cloneDG/CloneStep1.png[,500]

Step 2 (i). The user inputs **clone i/4** or **clone i/4 o/daily:0** to create 1 copy of the transaction at index 4 on
the date when command is called - for this example, current date when command is used is 02/12/2019.

image::clone/cloneDG/CloneStep2Part1.png[,500]
.Creating one copy of transaction at index 4 and adding it to the list.
image::clone/cloneDG/CloneStep2Part2.png[,500]

Step 2 (ii). The user removes the clone created in Step 2 (i) using **delete i/6** command.

Step 3. The user inputs **clone i/4 o/monthly:12** to create 12 copies of the transaction at index 4 with dates one
month apart from each other (30/12/2019 to 30/11/2020), and add them to the list. Input is parsed by
`CloneCommandParser#parse()` which creates a `**CloneCommand**`.

image::clone/cloneDG/CloneStep3.png[,500]

Step 4. `CloneCommand#execute()` creates copies of the transaction to be cloned with their dates of occurrence set one
month apart. The copies are then added to the list.

===== Execution observed by user
The following activity diagram gives an overview of what the user observes when executing **clone** command:

.Activity diagram for execution of **clone** command
image::clone/cloneDG/CloneActivityDiagram.png[,400]

==== Design considerations
This subsection explores some alternative designs considered for certain aspects of the feature's implementation.

===== Aspect: Representing occurrences for execution
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Implement a new class `**Occurrence**` to represent occurrences.
- Pros: Good Object-Oriented Programming design adhering to principles of abstraction and encapsulation. Utility methods
to process occurrences can be kept in a single class.
- Cons: More code and memory required for entire `**Occurrence**` class.

* **Alternative 2**: Directly pass the results from parsing occurrence representation in user input as parameters to
execution methods.
- Pros: Quick and efficient in producing parameters for execution.
- Cons: May be complicated to trace parameters when passing between different methods. Unable to implement utility
methods to process occurrences within a single class.

===== Aspect: Maintaining a store for valid values of `Occurrence#frequency`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Store valid `frequency` values within a static non-modifiable "final" array inside
`**Occurrence**`
- Pros: Implementation is simple with relatively little coding needed. Values cannot be modified after initialization of
array, preventing invalid values from being added later.
- Cons: An additional field of type array has to be included in `**Occurrence**` class.

* **Alternative 2**: Store valid values as `**Enum**`
- Pros: Validity of values in `**Enum**` form all but assured, there will never be invalid values.
- Cons: More code and memory required for entire `**Enum**` classes.
